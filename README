Some scripts to make a named zone file from the various PiHole DNS blocker lists.

The resulting zone file is pretty big and takes a while to load.

This uses my DBHelper library, which is a small little perl library I wrote to 
make dealing with DBI tasks a little more seamless and not have so much DBI->cruft in the code.

It should be fairly clear what the helper functions do.
